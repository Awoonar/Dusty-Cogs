##More cog information
###Autorole
This cog allows you to automatically assign new members of your server a role.
Usage:
 `[p]autorole role "the-role's-name-in-quotes"` sets the role to be given to new users.
 `[p]autorole toggle` switches the state of automatic role assignment
 `[p]autorole` displays help for autorole commands and shows whether autorole is on or off

###Greet
This cog will cause the bot to play a sound when a user joins the same voice channel as the bot.

Note: The bot will not play the join sound if the bot is playing music. Also, the owner can cause the bot to join their voice channel with the command `[p]joinvoice` in case the bot is not in a voice channel.
Usage:
 `[p]greetset sound "the-sound.extension"` sets the sound that plays when you join the voice channel
 `[p]greetset toggle server/user user-mention-if-needed` will toggle whether or not the bot will play a greeting sound for the server/a user
